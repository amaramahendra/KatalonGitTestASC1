The programs may contain or require the use of third party technology.

For clarity, the existence of a notice does not affect the terms under which third party technology is licensed to you.
Third party technology will be licensed to you either under the terms of this agreement or, if specified in the program documentation, readmes or notice files, under separate license terms (“separate terms”). Third party technology licensed under separate terms and not under the terms of this agreement is referred to as “separately licensed third party technology.” Notwithstanding any other terms of this agreement, your rights to use (including without limitation the right to distribute) such separately licensed third party technology under the separate terms are not restricted in any way by this agreement.
You may not:
remove, modify or obscure any program markings, proprietary markings, or any notice of ASC’s or its licensors’ proprietary rights in the ASCproperty;
license, sell, rent, lease, transfer or assign or otherwise make the ASCproperty available in any manner to any third party for use in the third party’s business operations (unless such access is expressly permitted for the specific ASCproduct you have acquired) or reproduce, display, disclose, distribute or use the ASCcontent or promotional materials except as expressly set forth in this agreement or an ASC PartnerNetwork benefit cloud services order;
create derivative works, cause or permit reverse engineering (unless required by law for interoperability), disassembly, or decompilation of ASCproperty (the foregoing prohibition includes but is not limited to review of data structures or similar materials produced by programs, ASCcloud services, or ASCcontent);
disclose results of any program benchmark tests without ASC’s prior written consent;
use the ASCproperty in a manner that misrepresents your relationship with ASCor is otherwise misleading or that reflects negatively on ASC;
use the ASCproperty for your own internal business operations;
access or use the ASCcontent or promotional materials in order to build or support, and/or assist a third party in building or supporting, products or services competitive to ASC;
engage in any conduct that may be detrimental to ASCor to the ASCproperty; or
enter into any agreement which requires you to take any actions that are in conflict with the terms of this agreement.
If you desire to use the ASCproperty for any use other than the use allowed under this agreement, including but not limited to the right to distribute the programs or ASCcloud services, you must enter into an appropriate agreement with ASCto acquire the necessary rights.

notify the General Counsel, ASCLegal Department, promptly in writing, not later than 30 days after you receive notice of the claim (or sooner if required by applicable law);
give ASCsole control of the defense and any settlement negotiations; and

If ASCbelieves or it is determined that any of the Indemnified Material may have violated someone else’s intellectual property rights based on your authorized use of the Indemnified Material in accordance with the terms of this agreement, ASCmay choose to either modify the Indemnified Material to be non-infringing (while substantially preserving its utility or functionality) or obtain a license to allow for continued use, or if these alternatives are not commercially reasonable, ASCmay end the license for the applicable Indemnified Material and refund any unused, prepaid technical support fees you have paid to ASC. ASCwill not indemnify you if you alter Indemnified Material or use it outside the scope of use identified in the program documentation or services specifications or if you use a version of the Indemnified Material which has been superseded, if the infringement claim could have been avoided by using an unaltered current version of the Indemnified Material which was provided to you. ASCwill not indemnify you to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon products or services not provided by ASC. ASCwill not indemnify you to the extent that an infringement claim is based on any third party content or material from a third party portal or another external source that is accessible or made available to you within or by the ASCcloud services (e.g. a social media post from a third party blog or forum, a third party Web page accessed via a hyperlink, marketing data from third party data providers, etc.). ASCwill not indemnify you to the extent that an infringement claim is based upon the combination of any Indemnified Material with any products or services not provided by ASC. ASCwill not indemnify you for infringement caused by your actions against any third party if the Indemnified Material as delivered to you and used by you in accordance with the terms of this agreement would not otherwise infringe any third party intellectual property rights.

If a third party makes a claim against ASCthat any information, design, specification, instruction, software, data, or material (“material”) furnished by you to ASCunder this agreement infringes their intellectual property right, you will indemnify ASC.
Solely with respect to separately licensed third party technology that is part of the programs and is used: (1) in unmodified form; (2) as part of the programs; (3) in accordance with the license grant for the relevant programs and all other terms and conditions of this agreement, and (4) in compliance with any of the separate terms that require (i) provision of notices in the form and to the extent provided by ASC, (ii) distribution of specified source code (in the form and to the extent such source code is provided by ASC), and/or (iii) distribution of the separately license third party technology under the separate terms in the form and to the extent provided by ASC, ASCwill provide indemnification for separately licensed third party technology to the same extent as ASCis required to provide indemnification for the programs under the terms of this agreement. ASCwill provide indemnification for third party technology that is part of the programs and not separately licensed third party technology to the same extent as ASCis required to provide indemnification for the programs under the terms of this agreement.
